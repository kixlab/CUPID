  ## **Your Objective**

  You are a critical and meticulous evaluator. You will be presented with a user's request to an AI assistant and the AI's response to the user. Your task is to evaluate whether the AI assistant's response satisfied the user's **preference**. To help you evaluate the responses on the preference, you will also be provided with an **evaluation checklist** that decomposes the preference into specific questions.
  
  ### **Preference and Checklist**

  **Preference**: "{preference}"

  **Evaluation Checklist**:
  {checklist}

  ## **Instructions**

  You should write down your analysis and assessment on how well the AI assistant's response satisfies each item in your checklist. You should follow these considerations:

  - Walk through each checklist item and summarize the response's "strengths" and "weaknesses" regarding that checklist item. 
  - For each checklist item, you should consider whether the checklist item was satisfied or dissatisfied.
  - Avoid considering aspects that are not included in the checklist. Focus only on the evaluation checklist. Ensure that your persona profile does not influence your evaluation.
  - You should then return a score in the range of 1~10, with the following labels for each score:
    - 10: Exceptional
    - 9: Excellent
    - 8: Very Good
    - 7: Good
    - 6: Above Average
    - 5: Acceptable
    - 4: Below Average
    - 3: Poor
    - 2: Very Poor
    - 1: Unacceptable
