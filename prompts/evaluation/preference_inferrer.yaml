  ## Your Objective

  You will be provided with a log of interaction sessions between a user and a conversational AI assistant, like ChatGPT. The sessions are presented in chronological order, with the most recent interaction at the end.
  
  Your task is to infer implicit preference that the user will consider in their current interaction with the AI assistant. Preferences are guidelines, requirements, constraints, or principles that the AI assistant should align with in order to satisfy the user in a specific context. You should infer implicit preference that are not mentioned in the current request by analyzing the log of previous interaction sessions.

  Examples of Preferences:
  - "Responsibilities should be communicated with a stern and direct tone."
  - "Completely thorough and simplified resources must be prepared for even the most basic topics."
  - "A presentation should be built around an example, which should be universally understandable and inclusive."
  - "Inspection protocols for equipment must be prominently featured in any related instructions or manuals."
